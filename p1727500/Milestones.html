            <p class="milestone_desc">
                First time going overseas with my school without my parents. It was only a week's worth of trip to Perth and yet very fulfilling. I learnt how to be independent and learnt more about the culture of Western Australia. Also, we visited a school and it was my first time socialising with friends at overseas. We lived in a farm for a few days and it was the best part of the trip. We got to interact with sheeps, goats and see them get shaved. Also, we got to see canola and nice smelling tinderwoods and at night, we get to see different constellations at night.

                Graduated and studied in Woodlands Ring Secondary School. Also studied hard while juggling with CCA. My overall performance was excellent in Secondary 1 and awarded with the Excellent Student Principal's Book Prize. As I was promoted to Secondary 3, I did not do well in studies due to the leap in gap of education and the increased resposibilities of CCA. Eventually, I continued working hard and was particularly proud that I improved my grades from C6 to B3 for English. Overall, I was satisfied with my O level's result because it I could go to the courses I wanted.

                My CCA was Vex Robotics. I learned how to code, design and build the robot from scratch and then how to control it. I joined my seniors for a competition during Secondary 1 and won bronze for Singapore Vex Robotics Championship and 1st for Autonomous Challenge in East Zone Robotics Challenge. I picked up the skills from my senior and was promoted to Vice Chairperson in Secondary 3. It was not easy leading and managing but I learn how to communicate effectively and lead the juniors by being a role model and showing them the right things to do. As a team, we work together to produce robots that could compete in national competitions and eventually we won quite a lot of awards. Robotics influenced me to be a think critically and solve problems efficiently. My passion for coding made me decided to study further in computer science.

                Besides CCAs and Academics, I also participated for sports events during sports day and sports festivals to earn class points and loosen my muscles once in a while. During secondary 2, I particpated in 4 X 100M relay with my classmates and achieved 3rd in position. However, I was not satisfied with third and participated again in 2016 for 4 X 100M CCA relay race and won a gold with a timing of 59 seconds. I also played handball for fun in 2015 to help my class score participation points and let some wind loose. Even though my teamates were not in sport CCAs, we did fairly well came in 3rd.

                To further pursue my interest in coding and techonology, I enrolled in Diploma of Information Technology in Singapore Polytechnic. Currently, I learned how to code proficiently in Java and C# with object oriented concept and link it with database like SQL. I now have a better understanding about networking and infocomm security too. Also, we get to learn how to create our own websites from scratch. With my strong interests and hard work, I achieved good grades for first semester and is gaining interests in data science recently.
